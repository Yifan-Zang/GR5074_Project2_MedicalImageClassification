**Project Overview**

This project builds a deep learning pipeline for medical image classification using the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset.
We compare a baseline CNN model, a ResNet transfer-learning model, and three additional architectures to evaluate performance and interpretability.
Our goals are to:
1. Explore dataset characteristics and handle class imbalance.
2. Train and compare multiple CNN architectures fairly using consistent splits.
3. Evaluate the impact of transfer learning and data augmentation.
4. Discuss model interpretability and real-world applications in medical diagnostics.
